Agents follow these without deviation unless the declaration 
explicitly requires otherwise. Deviation must be surfaced as 
a decision, not made silently.

## Architectural principles
- Feature files are the spec. They are never modified during implementation; if they are wrong, fix the document and restart the affected step.
- No Docker for local development unless the project has multi-service dependencies that genuinely require it.
- All deployments run through GitHub Actions, triggered by push to `main`.
- Prefer self-hosted runners (Eviebot) over SSH-based deploy steps.

[Add app-specific principles below as they are decided.]

## Patterns in use
- **Commits:** conventional commits, one per logical unit of work.
- **Frontend stack:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Vanilla JS is acceptable only for stateless single-page tools.
- **UI aesthetic:** information-dense, 14px base, tight line heights, dark mode as a first-class surface.
- **UX checklist:** apply Nielsen's 10 heuristics as a general sanity-check on any interface; Apple HIG (see Standards) is the authoritative reference for platform decisions.
- **Python service layout:** `pyproject.toml` with a console-script entry point (not `requirements.txt`); deployment plists live in `deploy/` (not `launchd/`).

[Add app-specific patterns below as they are established.]

## Quality gates
- All tests pass.
- `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` exist and are current.
- `.env.example` lists every key the deploy workflow injects — no drift between the committed example and the actual required secrets.
