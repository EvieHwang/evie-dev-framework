Agents follow these without deviation unless the declaration 
explicitly requires otherwise. Deviation must be surfaced as 
a decision, not made silently.

## Architectural principles
- Feature files are the spec. They are never modified during implementation; if they are wrong, fix the document and restart the affected step.
- No Docker for local development unless the project has multi-service dependencies that genuinely require it.
- All deployments run through GitHub Actions, triggered by push to `main`.
- Prefer self-hosted runners (Eviebot) over SSH-based deploy steps.

[Add app-specific principles below as they are decided.]

## Patterns in use
- **Commits:** conventional commits, one per logical unit of work.
- **Frontend stack:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Vanilla JS is acceptable only for stateless single-page tools.
- **UI aesthetic:** information-dense, 14px base, tight line heights, dark mode as a first-class surface.
- **UX checklist:** apply Nielsen's 10 heuristics as a general sanity-check on any interface; Apple HIG (see Standards) is the authoritative reference for platform decisions.
- **Python service layout:** `pyproject.toml` with a console-script entry point (not `requirements.txt`); deployment plists live in `deploy/` (not `launchd/`).

[Add app-specific patterns below as they are established.]

## Quality gates
- All tests pass — and CI runs the same build the deploy runs. If the test runner doesn't type-check/compile (Vitest, esbuild, isolatedModules), CI also runs the production build (`tsc` / `pnpm build` / `mypy` / `go build`).
- `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` exist and are current.
- `.env.example` lists every key the deploy workflow injects — no drift between the committed example and the actual required secrets.

## Testing
Framework: [populated by /tests on first use]
Run: `[command — populated by /tests on first use]`

## Out of scope
[List what this codebase explicitly does not do. Populated per app.]

## Acknowledged risks
*Cross-feature accumulation surface. Each adversarial finding marked `acknowledged` gets one row here so the project never silently forgets that it knowingly took on risk. Severity is the unmitigated severity — an acknowledged HIGH stays HIGH. Populated by `/adversarial` when a finding moves to `acknowledged`.*

| Feature | Finding | Severity | Risk | Rationale | Mitigation |

## Artifact formats

### State file
Location: features/[feature-name]-[number]/state.md
Format:
| ID | Description | Wave | Status | Notes |
|----|-------------|------|--------|-------|

Valid status values: pending, in-progress, complete, failed, deviation
Notes column captures: the commit SHA on completion; the failure reason on failure; for deviation — the design section contradicted and a pointer to build-deviations.md.
`deviation` means the task completed and its behavioral requirement is satisfied, but the implementation differed from design.md in a way that should flow back to the req↔arch loop. Treat it as `complete` for DAG-progress purposes; treat the deviation note as a candidate adversarial finding.
